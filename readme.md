# Dependencies
To put simply a Python 3.x interpreter and the corresponding random (usually built-in), and also the names library available via pip.

To install names on Windows or in a venv:

```
pip install names
```
For system library on Linux/OS X:
```
sudo pip3 install names
```
If that fails, try:
```
sudo pip install names
```

# Why?
When I first started in the venture of making the database (dubbed "Ticket Auction Manager" or "TAM") for the annual SPCA Theme Basket Auction, I struggled to find anonymous, and realistic data to fill it with. So I made a first iteration this application when I first started learning Python.

This version is simply me applying what I have learned so far to make a better organized and commented version of this application explained above.

This maybe a helpful script for those who want to test a database with a CSV column format like:

```
'ID', 'FirstName', 'LastName', 'PhoneNumber', 'prefersText'
```
